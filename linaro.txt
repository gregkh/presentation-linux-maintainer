Why I don't want your code

or
Linux Kernel maintainers, why are they so grumpy?

Here's the Linux kernel development process.

Patches flow from developers through maintainers, up to subsystem
maintainers, then to Linus for a release.

This is well known, and we have a lot of people contributing to Linux:
	big numbers go here

but what is a maintainer?

Maintainers are like editors in the publishing industry.  They work with
developers to review, edit, suggest, reject, and accept their patches.
Every once in a while, maintainers get to go back to doing what they
love to do, i.e. be a developer.

So, usually, if you waste a maintainer's time, you make them upset as
they could be doing more productive things, like new development of
their own, or accepting patches from other people that aren't wasting
their time.

How do you waste a maintainer's time?

- don't follow the documented submitsion process

Here's a list of some of the things that people sent me, in a span of
two weeks, that were wrong and they should have never sent:
  - patch [48/48] where there were no 47 other patches
  - 15 patches in a series with no order given
  - patch 1, 3-10, number 2 never showed up
  ..... (steal from other talk)

These were obvious things.

It is in my self-interest to ignore your patch

So, what to do about this:

give me no excuse to reject your patch
  ... steal from other talk...
