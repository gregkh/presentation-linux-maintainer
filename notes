Ways to piss off a maintainer with patches you send them:

- html patch
- other patch email client issues (outlook, line-wrapping, mime, base64,
  wierd extra spaces, tabs to spaces, etc.)
- patch does not apply
- patch does not build
- multiple patches with no ordering indicated
- patch made against unknown tree
- patch made against old kernel tree
- ask me to pull random git trees with no description of what is in them
- multi-patch series that breaks the build half way through the series
