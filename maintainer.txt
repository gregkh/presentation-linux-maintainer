Kernel maintainers - what they do, want, etc...


Last year, 3000 developers and 373 companies contributed to the kernel, the largest software project ever.

Here's the picture of how things work, 3000 developers, 700 maintainers, 130 subsystem maintainers.

5.xx changes a year

7.xx changes last release!

I've given lots of talks over the years about how to become a developer,
how to get involved, and what to do.  But what about those 700
maintainers?  What do they do?  What are they looking for when you send
them a patch?

Push/pull.  Every patch you send a maintainer increases their workload,
testing, support, and responsibility.  We review and accept thousands of
patches every year, keeping that rate of change going.


Make it impossible for me to reject your patch.

 - proper coding style
 - checkpatch.pl clean
 - proper people and mailing lists cc:ed (get_maintainer.pl)
 - proper subject
 - small incremental change
 - "obviously" correct
 - good description of WHY the patch is needed



What you should expect of a maintainerr
  - respond to the patch in 1-2 weeks (longer if in middle of merge
    window, or if at conferences.)
  - offer constructuve criticism of the patch
  -
